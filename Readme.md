# Milestone Project 3 - Local Cuisine Cook Book
-----------------------------------------------
Local Cuisine Cook Book is a built app from the knowledge and learning process which i've learned from 
all the modules and other projects i've done so far with Code Institute.

The Milestone project includes HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Python,MongoDB and Heroku.
Local Cuisine Cook Book is a fully responsive database-backed, Flask web application.
It is build and designed for the user's wants and needs, while ensuring that the site has a 
user friendly and interactive design expectation.

[You can view the live website here]()

Using the CRUD('Create, Read, Update, and Delete,') model of the website has been created to provide an online recipe cook Book
so the users can add their recipe, all they have to do is signup. Users are able to store,view,edit and delite their recipes
They can also create an account which will recognize them when they will login back to their account.
Users can also see the website and some added recipes but they would not be able to add,or delete if they didn't join the
the community one the website.

## UX
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wtih the Local Cuisine Cook Book we can learn from other comunities and other parts of the world,
how the food looks like and taste like so we can learn some new reciepies and dishehs made from all
over the world and try something new.

The website has already some recipes from the site owner to follow also it gives the example how 
the format looks like and enable users to have recipes ready available while the website is still new.
It also encourage othe users to create a free account and share their recipes of their own.

## Existing Website Features
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       NAVIGATION BAR: Allows users to navigate to the relevant section on the website, such as log in/log out
       they can add the recipes, find a recipe and user profile page where they can see their username, links to
       home paige and add paige.

    
       EDIT RECIPE BUTTON: User will be able to edit their own recipe when he/she is sign in by clickong on the      
       edit button, but they will not be able to edit recipes from other users.      

       LOGIN: User can Log In to their accounts simply by using username and password form. Once they are logged     
       in users with the help of MongoDB can add, edit or delete the recepies as well as search for recipes added by other users.      

       REGISTER: The register section will allow users to register to a website so they can add, edit or delite     
       recipes as well share them with others and search for recipes added from other users, first they will need     
       to fill up the form with a username and password which they can use it every time they will logged in.      

       THE ABILITY TO UPLOAD THE IMAGE: User will be able to upload the image with the recipe via Add recipe     
       and Edit Recipe form by including the URL to the image.      

       SEARCH BAR: Allows users to input the text that is used for search, display and query recipes to the users.     
       Search bar function is created using the JavaScript ajax method to send and recieve data.      

      EmailJS: The Website has available form where users can use it to send us the email.This was set with      
      using the EmailJS [https://www.emailjs.com/] service. The user will need to fill up three forms "Full Name",     
      "Email" and "Message" once everything is filled, the user can send us na email by clicking on a send buttonwhich uses      
      the EmailJS service to send us the email.


Features Left to Implement
----------------------------------------------

 * Ability for users to upload a profile image
 * Developing system that will allow users to create
   group folders to create and storage the recipes there together.
* Create a function to download or storage other people recipes.

## Technologies Used for Developing

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
   * The project website is using Bootstrap to provide the responsive toolkit for building the base of the website.

* [Flask](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html)
   * The project website is using Flask framework to provide the tools for developer that Allows
     to build a website aplication faster.

* [Font-Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
   * The project is using font awesome to use the icons for the website.

*  [GitHub](https://github.com/Github)     
   * The project is using GitHub for version control.

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)       
   * The project is using Python for routing and CRUD function.

* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
   * The project is using Heroku to deploy finished project.

* [EmaiJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
   * The project is using EmailJS for sending emails from website.

* [MongoDB-Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=bing&utm_campaign=bs_emea_united_kingdom_search_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=386028215&msclkid=47a6a9a906941a57c371c9af0c6a75d5)        
   * The project is using MongoDB-Atlas to store the data on this website

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
  * The project is using JQuery to simplify the DOM manipulation.

* [Google-Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)   
  * The project uses the Google Fonts to changing the font-famaly.

## Scheme Design
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* After the research for the elements of the website and the items needed to be stored 
  I've retrive it from database for two collections:

   * Users: for register and login they contain the Object ID, Username and Password.

   * Recipes: contains the element required for CRUD (create,read,update and delete).
    The values for the recipe collection are added into the database and pulled from the 
    database by users in the section AddRecipe,EditRecipe and ViewRecipe and also for delete
    the recipe from database.

#### Users: 
  * _id: to be able to find the user by assigning a uniq id.

  * username: where the username would like to be recognized as posting and editing the recipe to the site.

  * Password: The password for user to be able to login to the website.  

#### Recipes:
  * _id: Unique identifier for the recipe

  * Find_recipe: The search bar where user can find others users upload recipes

  *  recipe_name: The recipe name the user gives to the recipe.

  * image_url: a url to be suplied by user to add the image to their recipe.

  * ingredient_amount: where user can add amount and description of the recipe.

  * step_description: where user can describe the recipe step by step how to use it.       


## Tools Used
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [Balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/index.html)- To create my wireframes, showing the position of elements on varying screen sizes.

* [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) I used it to check my validity of the HTML code.

* [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) Iused this tool to check my validity of the CSS code.

* [Autoprefixed](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) I used this tool to check my prefixes of my CSS code.

* [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/) Used this tool to check my app.py file meets the PEP8 requirements.

## Testing
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Defensive Design

    * Submition with blank input is not allowed messages are displayed to inform users which necessary input sections are empty.

    * Misuse of the URL is prevented by using session and decorator functions, if the user is logged in or logged out.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[PEP 8 Compliance](http://pep8online.com/checkresult) I've used this tool to check if my app.py code complied with PEP8 requirements:

First test passed with no errors, which was help by Code Institute mini project guide how PEP8 works and from the actual site
reading help me to make it thrue with no errors.

[W3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) I've used this validator to check the validity of my
CSS code. They where no errors showed to limit coding or clashes.

[W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) I've used this validator to check the validity on all of my HTML pages
which is 12 of them.

[JSHint Validator](https://jshint.com/) I've used this validator to check the validity on all of my 7 js codes.

  * For every page in HTML document showe me error for attribute href element : Illegal character in path
  segment(Bad value {{url_for('edit_recipe', recipe_id=recipe._id)}} for attribute href on element a: 
  Illegal character in path segment: { is not allowed.) This showed me for every page that has a {url} in it.

  * About.html: Passed with no other errors.

  * AddRecipe.html: Passed with no other errors.

  * Contact.html: It was one error which was(<label for="full-name" class="tetx-jet">)i had to correct (for) to (id).
                Check it again in validator and no other errors was showed.

  * EditRecipe.html: No other errors where found.

  * Index.html: No othre error has been found. 

  * login.html: No other error has been found.

  * Logout.html: No other error has been found.

  * Profile.html: No other error has been found.  

  * Recipe.html: No other error has been found.

  * Recipes.html: No other error has been found.

  * Signup.html: No other error has been found. 
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * AddRecipe.js: It found two undefined properties ($, $ajax) and no error where found and no errors.

  * EditRecipe.js: One undefined variable found ($) and no errors where found and no errors.

  * Emailjs.js: One warning (Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression.), and 
                Two undefined variables found($, emaijs) and no errors.

  * RecipeSearch.js: Three undefined variable found ($, $ajax and i) and no errors.              

  * Script.js: One warning show (Misleading line break before '?'; readers may interpret this as an expression boundary.),
            and one undefined variable (jQuery) and no errors where found.

  * Signup.js: Two undefined variables ($, $ajax), and no errors where found.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Style.css: No errors where found:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * App.py: No errors where found only one warning for (no newline at end of file) .

#### User Story Testing:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New External User Goals: As a new user, I want to be able to view recipe books.

   * There are two call actions in the website for user to see the website recipes.
     You can find one in the main search bar and the other one under the main paige with a large
     search bar (Please enter your Dish name Here with the search button on the right side).


### Frequent User Goals:

* Add Recipe Function:
 As a frequent user i want to be able to share my recipes to the website with other members as well.

 * Once loged in the user will be welcome on the paige with the button below to get started, once click
   on the button it will be allowed to add the recipe to the website. Below it's a button to the paige 
   add recipe. Once click on it you will be able to add your own.

* Sign Up Function:

As a user, I want to be able to register to the website and post my own recipe.

   * You will find the sign up button in the bottom of the website when you scroll
     down to the bottom of the website and click on it. It will direct you to the sign up paige where,
     you will put your details in and singn up as a new user.
     If there is no user in the data with the same email, the user account does not exist yet.
     If the email was used already before to create an account, sign up will not be allowed.


* Login Function:

   * If there is no session no one is logged in if its true user has logged in.The email and password
     must be correct then user session is started and user information is stored to the session.
     If the criteria is not met, the status code will be returning the error message and will be displayed 
     to the user. The criteria must be satisfied only then the app will create user session and will be logged in.

* Edit Recipe Function:

    * When user is logged in her/his session (_id) key match the (user_id) key from the recipe, then the 
      edit button will be shown in section of the recipe card. The button will allow you to edit the recipe
      you put in to the app by targeting the URL of the function from the edit recipe paige.

* Profile Function:

    * Profile is accesible only when the user did create the session if he/she is logged in, it will be 
      displayed on the recipes that the user created before.It does this by matching the users _id and
      recipe _id key.If the criteria is satisfied the app will dispaly users recipe and buttons that will
      allowed user to use the CRUD function.

* Delete Recipe Function      
    * When user is logged in and his key _id is matching with user_id key from the recipe, then the delete
      button will be shown in the bottom section of the recipe card. The button will allow to delete the 
      recipe from the page and database.
      If the user is not logged in the decorator function will prevent the user to get acces to page manually.

* The Error Function
    * Most of the request are done with ajax call on this website. Ajax allows to 'POST' from input data to
      view function, it will recieve the data and then run a set of commands after which can be return as able
      result through the JSON format and return a status code based on it's result.
      
### Testing Deployment

  
  * All the code written was tested and retested.
  * Login system was tested using the bogus emails and passwords.
  * Login system was tested using the correct email and password.
  * Sign Up was tested with using the different emails.
  * Search bar was tested by inputing values that don't exist in the database and 
    searching for the value that exists by inputing numbers and symbols.

  Here are lists of manually tested stories:

  1. Paige Anchor Tags:
    * In the Home paige try to click on the logo (Local Cuisine with the book logo on left side), and it 
      should reload the paige.

    * If you try to repeat for all other anchor tags [Home paige, About page, Recipe page and Contact page],
     each one of the should take you to a different site and if you click on each of the sites on a logo with
     [Local Cuisine book] it should take you back to home page.
      
 2. Navigation Bar:

    * If you go to Home page, try to downsize it and at some poitn should collapse to small hamburger icon,
      then try to click on that hamburger icon and should open you a mobile navigation menu. if you try to 
      increase browser window size while nav is open at some point it should go back to initial position.   
     
    * If you go to Contact Us page and try to submit an empty form and verify that an error message about 
      requried fields appears.If you try to submit the form with an false email address and verify the error
      message will appear.

Using the Bootstrap layout and mobile development method , allowedme to build and create an responsive
website page. From the content resize to the size of the displayed screen, this was tested all with
Google Inspect Tool that allowed me to resize the screen and see how my website response to different
device screen size.

### Deployment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For this project I've used the [GitHub](https://github.com/Github) platform where i created my [repository]
(https://github.com/Tomazdo10/Local-Cuisine-Cook-Book) using a template provided to me by [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/)
Once the repository was created I've used browser IDE addon for GitPod, to open the repository.
Using this IDE i was able to make my commits and push all of my code to GitHub.When project was complited
it was deployed through [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps).

Deployment proces step by step:
 
  1. Go to repository
  2. Open the repository using GitPod IDE.
  3. In the terminal run "PIP3 freeze --local"-requirements.txt command to create the txt. file with all the
     dependencies used that Heroku needs to know what app uses.
  4. In the terminal run the "echo web: python app.py- Procfile command to create Procfile that Heroku need'same
     to know which file runs the app.
  5. Check the files you created and if Procfile has a blank line under the first line, delete the blank line.
  6. Go to Heroku and log in.
  7. When you are logged in add your dashboard, click "create new app"
  8. Under the "create new app" click the input field called "App Name"
  9. Give your app a Unique Name using minus or dash instead of using just empty spaces betwen words.
  10. Select the region colses to you.
  11. Click "Create App" 
  12. To connect the app you will set up automatic deployment by clicking on the GitHub icon inside the
      "Deployment Method" display inside it.
  13. Under the Deployment Method you will see the section connect to GitHub and make shore your Github
      profile is displayed inside it.
  14. Insert the repo-name inside the Connect to GitHub section. This input file can be found to the right
      of where your profile is displayed.
  15. Click Search
  16. When it finds your repo, click on the connect button.
  17. Before clicking the Enable Automatic Deployment button click on the settings tab in the top of the page.
  18. Click on Reveal Config Var.
  19. Here you can tell Heroku which variables are required.
  20. Variables Inserted[MONGO_URI,PORT,ID,MOGODB_NAME,SECRET_KEY].
  21. Go back to the GitHub IDE and make sure that you have pushed your requirements.txt and Procfile to the repo.
  22. Get back to Heroku and click Enable Automatic Deployment.
  23. Select your branch (Branch selected master).
  24. Click Deploy Branch
  25. It will take some time build the app in Heroku.
  26. When the site is Deployed click View to lunch the new app.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Secret key & Variables:

Secret Key should not be pushed to GitHub or shared with anyone, to avoid this to happens I've included my
Secret Key and key variables file which is stored locally.
The file env.py includes these key variable and secret key.
To stop the file being pushed to GitHub when commits are made  and pushed was created the (gitignore file)
which included the file name within it.
Every time commits and pushed the evn.py file is ignored.
