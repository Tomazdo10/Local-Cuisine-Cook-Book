# Milestone Project 3 - Local Cuisine Cook Book
-----------------------------------------------
Local Cuisine Cook Book is a built app from the knowledge and learning process which i've learned from 
all the modules and other projects i've done so far with Code Institute.

The Milestone project includes HTML,CSS,JavaScript,Python,MongoDB and Heroku.
Local Cuisine Cook Book is a fully responsive database-backed, Flask web application.
It is build and designed for the user's wants and needs, while ensuring that the site has a 
user friendly and interactive design expectation.

You can view the live website here:

Using the CRUD('Create, Read, Update, and Delete,') model of the website has been created to provide an online recipe cook Book
so the users can add their recipe, all they have to do is signup. Users are able to store,view,edit and delite their recipes
They can also create an account which will recognize them when they will login back to their account.
Users can also see the website and some added recipes but they would not be able to add,or delete if they didn't join the
the community one the website.

## UX
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wtih the Local Cuisine Cook Book we can learn from other comunities and other parts of the world,
how the food looks like and taste like so we can learn some new reciepies and dishehs made from all
over the world and try something new.

The website has already some recipes from the site owner to follow also it gives the example how 
the format looks like and enable users to have recipes ready available while the website is still new.
It also encourage othe users to create a free account and share their recipes of their own.
